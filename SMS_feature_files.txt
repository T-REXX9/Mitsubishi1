Modified and New Files for SMS Feature

Summary:
This change adds an SMS feature with a new page, sidebar navigation entries for Admin and Sales Agent, topbar title mapping, an accessible tabbed interface (Send, Templates, History), a reusable Not Authorized component, and localStorage-backed data for Templates and History. All UI elements use theme tokens from includes/css/common-styles.css and meet keyboard accessibility and WCAG AA contrast requirements.

Files:
- Modified:
  - includes/components/sidebar.php
    - Added "SMS" nav item for Admin under a new "Communications" group placed after "Customer Inquiries"
    - Added "SMS" nav item for Sales Agent under "Customer Management" directly after "Customer Chats"
    - Both links use aria-current="page" when active and leverage the existing active state pattern
  - includes/components/topbar.php
    - Added page title mapping: 'sms' => 'SMS'

- New:
  - includes/components/not_authorized.php
    - Reusable 403/Not Authorized component styled with theme tokens
    - Accessible markup and focus-visible states
  - pages/main/sms.php
    - New SMS page using the primary layout wrapper (sidebar + topbar)
    - Role guard allows only Admin and SalesAgent (supports both "SalesAgent" and "Sales Agent")
    - If unauthorized, http_response_code(403) and renders the Not Authorized component
    - Header with title "SMS" and short description
    - Accessible tabs (Send, Templates, History) with role="tablist"/"tab", aria-selected, aria-controls, roving tabindex, keyboard navigation (Left/Right/Home/End), and visible focus indicators
    - Send tab: E.164 recipient validation, message textarea with live character counter and GSM-7 vs Unicode segment estimation (160/153, 70/67), optional Sender ID (feature-flag, hidden by default), SweetAlert2 toast feedback, and disabled button during submission
    - Templates tab: table/list with search and sort controls, create/edit/delete via modal pattern, inline validation, empty/loading states, persistence via localStorage (no seeded mock data)
    - History tab: paginated, sortable, filterable table; details drawer; empty/loading states; history appended upon successful Send; persistence via localStorage
    - Responsive behaviors: tabs horizontally scrollable; tables degrade to stacked cards on small screens
    - No network calls; UI-only behavior as requested

Behavioral Notes:
- Navigation:
  - Admin: "Communications" group with "SMS" appears after "Customer Inquiries".
  - Sales Agent: "SMS" appears under "Customer Management" after "Customer Chats".
- Route:
  - Page path: pages/main/sms.php
  - Sidebar links: sms.php (consistent with existing relative URL conventions in main)
- Accessibility:
  - All interactive elements are keyboard navigable with visible focus indicators.
  - ARIA attributes applied to tabs and status/live regions.
- Styling:
  - Uses only CSS variables from includes/css/common-styles.css. No hardcoded colors.
- Data:
  - Templates and History persist to browser localStorage keys:
    - sms_templates
    - sms_history
- Security:
  - No credentials or secrets added.
  - Input validation for phone numbers in E.164 format.
- Performance/Optimization:
  - Minimal inline styles scoped to the page; relies on shared theme tokens.
  - No unused libraries added.

Testing Checklist:
- Login as Admin or Sales Agent and open pages/main/sms.php; the sidebar item highlights and aria-current="page" is set.
- Login as an unauthorized role; opening pages/main/sms.php renders the Not Authorized UI and sets HTTP 403.
- Validate phone input error messaging and segment calculations by typing GSM-7 and Unicode characters.
- Create, edit, delete templates; search, sort; verify persistence on page reload.
- Send a message; watch SweetAlert2 toast; confirm History entry; open details drawer.
- Resize to small screens; verify horizontal tab scroll and card-based list/table fallbacks.

No database or backend changes were required for this UI-only feature.
